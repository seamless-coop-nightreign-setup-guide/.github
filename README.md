> This setup **does not modify** core game files and only utilizes modded co-op scripts. It does not bypass Steam DRM or patch game binaries. It is intended for personal use and mod-friendly environments.

**Does this work with other mods?**  
> Partial compatibility. Most cosmetic and enemy randomizer mods are supported. Overhaul mods may conflict.

**Can I play without internet?**
